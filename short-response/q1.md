# Question

In your own words, what is React and what are the benefits of using it?

# Answer

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI components, which are small, self-contained pieces of code that define how a part of the user interface should appear and behave.

Benefits: 

1: React allows you to break down your user interface into reusable components. This allows your the developer to maintain their code easier 
2: Allows you to build bigger applications easier 
3: React uses a virtual DOM, which is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM.
