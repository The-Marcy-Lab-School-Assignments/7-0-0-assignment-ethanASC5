# Question

What is the return value of the `useState` hook in React? Be specific â€” just telling us the type is not enough.

# Answer
The useState hook in React returns an array with exactly two elements Current State Value and State Setter Function. From what I remember.The useState hook provides a way to "remember" values between renders and update them when necessary. 


Current State Value is the first element of the array is the current value of the state. This value is whatever you passed as the initial state when you called.

State Setter Function: The second element is a function that allows you to update the state. You can call this function with a new value to update the state, and React will re-render the component with the new state value.
