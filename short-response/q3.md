# Question

What happens when the setter function returned by `useState` is invoked?

# Answer

The setter function schedules an update to the current state value. React then triggers a re-render of the component using the updated state value.T he component and all of its child components will re-render, reflecting the new state. During the re-render, React performs a process called reconciliation, where it compares the new virtual DOM with the previous virtual DOM. Therefore, if you console.log the state value immediately after calling the setter function, it will reflect the old state value because the re-render has not occurred yet. Essentially, the current state value only gets updated after the re-rendering
Finally, The component's function is called again, and the updated state is used to determine the new output.
